/**
 * \file ascon128.h
 * \brief ASCON-128 encryption algorithm and related family members.
 *
 * The ASCON family consists of several related algorithms:
 *
 * \li ASCON-128 with a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, a 128-bit authentication
 * tag, and a block rate of 64 bits.
 * \li ASCON-128a with a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, a 128-bit authentication
 * tag, and a block rate of 128 bits.  This is faster than ASCON-128 but may
 * not be as secure.
 * \li ASCON-80pq with a 160-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, a 128-bit authentication
 * tag, and a block rate of 64 bits.  This is similar to ASCON-128 but has a
 * 160-bit key instead which may be more resistant against quantum computers.
 * \li ASCON-HASH with a 256-bit hash output.
 *
