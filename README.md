Lightweight Cryptography Primitives
===================================

*Note:* The 10 finalists of the NIST lightweight cryptography competition
were announced in March 2021.  I have forked this repository to create a new
[repository](https://github.com/rweather/lwc-finalists) for the
finalists and further improvements.  This repository is now archived.

This repository contains implementations of many of the second round
submissions to the [NIST lightweight cryptography competition](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography/round-2-candidates).

The [documentation](https://rweather.github.io/lightweight-crypto/index.html)
contains more information on the algorithms and their performance.
