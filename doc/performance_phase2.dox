\section perf_phase2_intro Introduction

NIST set a cut-off of 18 Septeber 2020 for status updates from
the Round 2 candidate submission teams.  Since that date, some newer
implementations have been contributed by others and written by myself.

The performance of the newer versions can be found on this page.
The performance original "baseline" versions can be found on the
\ref performance "original page".

For phase 2, I am focusing mainly on the 32-bit ARM Cortex M3
microprocessor in the Arduino Due device that I used for previous
testing.  ESP32 and AVR figures may be included if they provide
interesting results.

\section perf_phase2_ascon ASCON and GASCON

The baseline versions of ASCON-128, ASCON-128a, and ASCON-80pq for
32-bit platforms use the 32-bit bit-sliced representation.  Plaintext
and associated data is converted into bit-sliced form prior to being
absorbed by the permutation.  Squeezed ciphertext and the tag are
converted from bit-sliced form to regular form on output.

GASCON128 was part of the DryGASCON submission to Round 2.  It is
identical to ASCON except that the input and output of the permutation
are already in 32-bit bit-sliced form.

Sébastien Riou of the DryGASCON submission team contributed versions of
ASCON-128, ASCON-128a, and ASCON-80pq where the GASCON128 permutation was
directly substituted for ASCON.  This avoids the need to convert back and
forth between bit-sliced form and regular form.
